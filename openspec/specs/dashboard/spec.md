# dashboard Specification

## Purpose
Render the OpenSpec project as a local browser dashboard: progress at a glance,
per-change detail, and a read-only specs browser, all driven from the parsed
Markdown.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Change Overview
The system SHALL list active changes as cards, each showing the change id, an
intent summary, and a progress bar derived from its tasks.md checklist.

#### Scenario: Partial completion
- **WHEN** a change has 2 of 6 tasks checked
- **THEN** its card shows a 33% progress bar and "2/6"

### Requirement: Change Detail
The system SHALL present each change with Tasks, Proposal, Design, and Delta
Specs views.

#### Scenario: Toggle from the Tasks view
- **WHEN** the user clicks a task checkbox in the Tasks view
- **THEN** the checkbox updates immediately and the underlying tasks.md is edited

### Requirement: Specs Browser
The system SHALL render the current specs under `openspec/specs/` as read-only
requirements with their Given/When/Then scenarios.

#### Scenario: View a capability spec
- **WHEN** the user opens the Specs page
- **THEN** each capability's requirements and scenarios are displayed

### Requirement: Live Connection Indicator
The system SHALL show whether the live WebSocket connection is active and SHALL
apply pushed updates without a manual refresh.

#### Scenario: External update arrives
- **WHEN** a change is edited outside the UI
- **THEN** the affected card or task list updates in place

### Requirement: Archived Change Detail Fallback
The system SHALL recognize when a Change Detail URL refers to an archived change
id and SHALL render an "Archived" panel instead of the generic not-found
message, so users who just archived a change are not shown a misleading error.

#### Scenario: Land on an archived id
- **WHEN** the user navigates to /change/<id> where <id> is present in the archive
- **THEN** the page shows an "Archived" panel with the archive date and final task progress

#### Scenario: Live transition after archiving the current change
- **WHEN** the user archives the change they are currently viewing and the watcher pushes the new state
- **THEN** the page swaps to the "Archived" panel without requiring a manual navigation

#### Scenario: Land on an unknown id
- **WHEN** the user navigates to /change/<id> where <id> is neither active nor archived
- **THEN** the existing "Change not found" message is shown unchanged

### Requirement: Back to Overview From Archived State
The system SHALL show a prominent "Back to Overview" link from the archived
panel so the user always has an obvious next step.

#### Scenario: Return to Overview
- **WHEN** the user is on the Archived panel
- **THEN** a link back to / is visible and operates a standard client-side navigation

### Requirement: Tags Top-Nav Entry
The system SHALL include a "Tags" entry in the top navigation between Specs
and Docs, so the cross-cutting view of artifacts is one click away from any
page.

#### Scenario: Tags link visible
- **WHEN** the dashboard is open
- **THEN** the top navigation shows Overview, Specs, Tags, Docs in that order

### Requirement: Clickable Tag Chips on Change Surfaces
The system SHALL render any tags declared on a change (in the proposal's
frontmatter, when present) as clickable chips on the change card on Overview
and on the change detail header, navigating to the corresponding tag page.

#### Scenario: Tag chips on Overview cards
- **WHEN** a change proposal declares tags
- **THEN** the change card on Overview shows them as chips that link to /tags/<ns>/<name>

#### Scenario: Tag chips on change detail
- **WHEN** the user opens a change detail page whose proposal declares tags
- **THEN** the detail header shows the tag chips next to the progress bar

### Requirement: Outcome on the Archived Panel
The system SHALL render an archived change's `outcome.md` (when present) on
the Archived panel of the Change Detail page, below the existing summary, so
the lessons learned from a completed change are visible to anyone revisiting
it.

#### Scenario: Outcome present
- **WHEN** the user views /change/<id> for an archived change whose archive directory contains outcome.md
- **THEN** the page renders the outcome body below the archive metadata, as rendered markdown

#### Scenario: No outcome
- **WHEN** the archived change has no outcome.md
- **THEN** the Archived panel renders as before with no outcome section

### Requirement: Outcome Indicator on Archive List
The system SHALL display an "outcome" indicator next to each Archive list
entry on Overview whose archive directory contains outcome.md, so users can
see at a glance which completed changes have written reflections.

#### Scenario: Archive entry has an outcome
- **WHEN** the Overview Archive list shows an entry that has outcome.md
- **THEN** the entry shows an outcome indicator alongside the date and progress

#### Scenario: Archive entry has no outcome
- **WHEN** the Overview Archive list shows an entry that has no outcome.md
- **THEN** no outcome indicator is shown for that entry
