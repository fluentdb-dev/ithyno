# dashboard Specification

## Purpose
Render the OpenSpec project as a local browser dashboard: progress at a glance,
per-change detail, and a read-only specs browser, all driven from the parsed
Markdown.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Change Overview
The system SHALL list active changes as cards, each showing the change id, an
intent summary, and a progress bar derived from its tasks.md checklist.

#### Scenario: Partial completion
- **WHEN** a change has 2 of 6 tasks checked
- **THEN** its card shows a 33% progress bar and "2/6"

### Requirement: Change Detail
The system SHALL present each change with Tasks, Proposal, Design, and Delta
Specs views.

#### Scenario: Toggle from the Tasks view
- **WHEN** the user clicks a task checkbox in the Tasks view
- **THEN** the checkbox updates immediately and the underlying tasks.md is edited

### Requirement: Specs Browser
The system SHALL render the current specs under `openspec/specs/` as read-only
requirements with their Given/When/Then scenarios.

#### Scenario: View a capability spec
- **WHEN** the user opens the Specs page
- **THEN** each capability's requirements and scenarios are displayed

### Requirement: Live Connection Indicator
The system SHALL show whether the live WebSocket connection is active and SHALL
apply pushed updates without a manual refresh.

#### Scenario: External update arrives
- **WHEN** a change is edited outside the UI
- **THEN** the affected card or task list updates in place

### Requirement: Archived Change Detail Fallback
The system SHALL recognize when a Change Detail URL refers to an archived change
id and SHALL render an "Archived" panel instead of the generic not-found
message, so users who just archived a change are not shown a misleading error.

#### Scenario: Land on an archived id
- **WHEN** the user navigates to /change/<id> where <id> is present in the archive
- **THEN** the page shows an "Archived" panel with the archive date and final task progress

#### Scenario: Live transition after archiving the current change
- **WHEN** the user archives the change they are currently viewing and the watcher pushes the new state
- **THEN** the page swaps to the "Archived" panel without requiring a manual navigation

#### Scenario: Land on an unknown id
- **WHEN** the user navigates to /change/<id> where <id> is neither active nor archived
- **THEN** the existing "Change not found" message is shown unchanged

### Requirement: Back to Overview From Archived State
The system SHALL show a prominent "Back to Overview" link from the archived
panel so the user always has an obvious next step.

#### Scenario: Return to Overview
- **WHEN** the user is on the Archived panel
- **THEN** a link back to / is visible and operates a standard client-side navigation

### Requirement: Tags Top-Nav Entry
The system SHALL include a "Tags" entry in the top navigation between Specs
and Docs, so the cross-cutting view of artifacts is one click away from any
page.

#### Scenario: Tags link visible
- **WHEN** the dashboard is open
- **THEN** the top navigation shows Overview, Specs, Tags, Docs in that order

### Requirement: Clickable Tag Chips on Change Surfaces
The system SHALL render any tags declared on a change (in the proposal's
frontmatter, when present) as clickable chips on the change card on Overview
and on the change detail header, navigating to the corresponding tag page.

#### Scenario: Tag chips on Overview cards
- **WHEN** a change proposal declares tags
- **THEN** the change card on Overview shows them as chips that link to /tags/<ns>/<name>

#### Scenario: Tag chips on change detail
- **WHEN** the user opens a change detail page whose proposal declares tags
- **THEN** the detail header shows the tag chips next to the progress bar

### Requirement: Outcome on the Archived Panel
The system SHALL render an archived change's `outcome.md` (when present) on
the Archived panel of the Change Detail page, below the existing summary, so
the lessons learned from a completed change are visible to anyone revisiting
it.

#### Scenario: Outcome present
- **WHEN** the user views /change/<id> for an archived change whose archive directory contains outcome.md
- **THEN** the page renders the outcome body below the archive metadata, as rendered markdown

#### Scenario: No outcome
- **WHEN** the archived change has no outcome.md
- **THEN** the Archived panel renders as before with no outcome section

### Requirement: Outcome Indicator on Archive List
The system SHALL display an "outcome" indicator next to each Archive list
entry on Overview whose archive directory contains outcome.md, so users can
see at a glance which completed changes have written reflections.

#### Scenario: Archive entry has an outcome
- **WHEN** the Overview Archive list shows an entry that has outcome.md
- **THEN** the entry shows an outcome indicator alongside the date and progress

#### Scenario: Archive entry has no outcome
- **WHEN** the Overview Archive list shows an entry that has no outcome.md
- **THEN** no outcome indicator is shown for that entry

### Requirement: Run Button Suppressed When Only Verification Remains
The system SHALL suppress the Kanban Run button on a card when every
remaining unchecked task lives under a section whose title contains
"verif" (case-insensitive), so the agent is not invited to act on work
that requires human judgment.

#### Scenario: Only verification tasks remain
- **WHEN** a change in TODO or IN-PROGRESS has unchecked tasks ONLY in sections whose titles contain "verif"
- **THEN** the Run button is hidden and the card shows the muted text "verify only" in its place

#### Scenario: Non-verify work remains
- **WHEN** a change has at least one unchecked task in a section whose title does not contain "verif"
- **THEN** the Run button is shown as before

#### Scenario: No tasks parsed
- **WHEN** a change has no `tasks.md` or its tasks failed to parse
- **THEN** the Run button is shown (we cannot prove there is no actionable work)

#### Scenario: All tasks checked
- **WHEN** every task is checked and the change is in DONE
- **THEN** the card behaves as today (Archive button, no Run); this requirement does not affect DONE

### Requirement: IN-PROGRESS Column Start Launcher
The Kanban IN-PROGRESS column SHALL expose a header-level Start launcher
button — visually and semantically parallel to the TODO column's
`+ New Change` button — that opens a popover listing every change ready to
run and dispatches the shared start flow when one is picked, so users can
kick off parallel implementations without leaving the column they are
watching progress in.

#### Scenario: Launcher renders with count
- **WHEN** the IN-PROGRESS column mounts and there is at least one startable candidate
- **THEN** the header shows `Start ▾` with a candidate-count badge and the button is enabled

#### Scenario: Launcher renders disabled when there are no candidates
- **WHEN** every change is already running, completed, or has only verify-only work left
- **THEN** the launcher button is disabled with the reason `"Nothing startable — all changes are already running or have verify-only work left."`

#### Scenario: Launcher renders disabled when agents.yaml is empty
- **WHEN** `agents.length === 0`
- **THEN** the launcher button is disabled with the reason `"No agents in agents.yaml."`

#### Scenario: Popover lists startable candidates
- **WHEN** the user clicks the launcher and candidates exist
- **THEN** a popover anchored to the button lists each startable change with its id, tags summary, and current progress (`done/total`)

#### Scenario: Startable filter uses shared predicates
- **WHEN** the launcher computes its candidate list
- **THEN** it uses the same `hasNonVerifyWork` and `isRunningOrPending` predicates that the card-level Start button uses; the two agree on what counts as startable

#### Scenario: Pick dispatches through shared start flow
- **WHEN** the user picks a candidate
- **THEN** the launcher calls `useStartFlow().startImplementation(change)` — reading `proposal.execution` and either dispatching directly (worktree/terminal) or opening the ExecutionPicker — exactly as the card-level Start would

#### Scenario: Card visibly moves to IN-PROGRESS
- **WHEN** the picked change starts and the resulting job is running
- **THEN** the card renders in the IN-PROGRESS column (existing `bucketize` job-aware behavior) alongside any peers already running

#### Scenario: Popover dismissal
- **WHEN** the user clicks outside the popover or presses Escape
- **THEN** the popover closes and no start is triggered

#### Scenario: Parallel spawn permitted
- **WHEN** the user picks a candidate while another change already has a running job
- **THEN** the new change spawns its own worktree + agent process; both jobs run concurrently (no queueing or global lock)

### Requirement: Electron Channel Documented
The system documentation SHALL list the Electron desktop app alongside the
CLI and the VS Code extension as a supported distribution channel, so users
on any editor / no editor can find an entry point.

#### Scenario: README mentions Electron
- **WHEN** a user reads the project README
- **THEN** they see the Electron app described next to the CLI and VS Code extension, with a link to install instructions

#### Scenario: Migration guide includes Electron path
- **WHEN** a user follows the migration guide
- **THEN** "Install the Electron app" is offered as a Stage-2 alternative alongside the CLI invocation
