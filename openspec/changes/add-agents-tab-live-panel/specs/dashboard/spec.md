## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Agents Tab Runtimes Section

The Agents tab SHALL render a Runtimes section at the top that lists every runtime declared in `agents.yaml` alongside its installation status obtained from `GET /api/agents/runtimes`. Each row SHALL show the runtime name, an installed / not-installed indicator, and (when installed) the runtime's advertised capabilities (`interactive`, `artifactOutput`, `diff`). The section SHALL provide a Refresh control that re-fetches the endpoint with `?refresh=1` so users can re-check installation status after installing a missing runtime.

#### Scenario: no runtimes declared
- **GIVEN** `agents.yaml` has no `runtimes:` section (or the section is empty)
- **WHEN** the Agents tab renders
- **THEN** the Runtimes section is not displayed

#### Scenario: mix of installed and missing runtimes
- **GIVEN** `agents.yaml` declares `claude` (installed) and `copilot` (not installed)
- **WHEN** the Agents tab renders
- **THEN** the section shows both entries with distinct installed / not-installed styling

#### Scenario: refresh re-fetches
- **GIVEN** a runtime previously reported as not installed has since been installed
- **WHEN** the user clicks Refresh in the Runtimes section
- **THEN** the client calls `GET /api/agents/runtimes?refresh=1` and the row updates to installed without a full page reload

### Requirement: Agents Tab Live Section

The Agents tab SHALL render a Live section listing agent jobs whose `status` is `"running"`. Each row SHALL display the agent name, a role badge (from `job.role`), a runtime badge (from `job.runtime`), the change id as a link to the change detail page, and the elapsed time since `job.startedAt`. The row SHALL retain the existing drill-in behavior (expandable Output / Diff tabs) landed by prior changes. Jobs whose status is not `"running"` SHALL NOT appear in this section.

#### Scenario: running job shows role and runtime badges
- **GIVEN** an agent job with `role: "code"` and `runtime: "aider"`, status `"running"`
- **WHEN** the Agents tab renders
- **THEN** the Live section row displays both `code` and `aider` badges

#### Scenario: no running jobs
- **GIVEN** all jobs are in a terminal state
- **WHEN** the Agents tab renders
- **THEN** the Live section shows an empty-state hint such as "No agents currently running."

#### Scenario: orphan job in live
- **GIVEN** an orphan-adopted job (role `"orphan"`, runtime `"unknown"`) with status `"running"` or `"orphaned"`
- **WHEN** the Agents tab renders
- **THEN** the row appears with the orphan role badge (Phase 3.4 extension is honored)

### Requirement: Agents Tab Verdict Badge On Recent Jobs

Each recent-job row SHALL display a verdict badge when the underlying job's `verdict` field is populated (per Phase 3.5's Job Model Includes Verdict). A `verdict.verdict === "pass"` result SHALL render as a green pass indicator with the optional summary. A `verdict.verdict === "needs-rework"` result SHALL render as an amber indicator including the finding count. Jobs without a `verdict` field SHALL show no badge (the absence itself signals "this was not a review job or the review artifact was malformed").

#### Scenario: pass verdict badge
- **GIVEN** a finished review-role job whose `verdict.verdict` is `"pass"`
- **WHEN** the row renders
- **THEN** a green badge labelled "pass" is shown (optionally with the summary text)

#### Scenario: needs-rework badge with count
- **GIVEN** a finished review-role job whose `verdict.verdict` is `"needs-rework"` and whose `verdict.findings` contains 3 entries
- **WHEN** the row renders
- **THEN** an amber badge labelled "needs-rework (3)" is shown

#### Scenario: no verdict on non-review job
- **GIVEN** a finished code-role job with no `verdict` field
- **WHEN** the row renders
- **THEN** no verdict badge is displayed
