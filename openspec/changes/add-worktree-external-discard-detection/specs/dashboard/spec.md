## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: External Worktree Discard Detection
The dashboard SHALL detect worktree removals performed outside the UI
(terminal `git worktree remove`, editor git panels, cleanup scripts)
and update the Kanban card state accordingly, without requiring a
server restart. Detection is driven by the existing per-job
`worktree-progress` watcher's `unlink` event on `tasks.md`.

#### Scenario: Terminal-driven discard clears the job
- **GIVEN** an agent job in `running` / `completed` / `crashed` / `cancelled` / `orphaned` state whose worktree exists at `.worktrees/<id>/`
- **WHEN** the user runs `git worktree remove .worktrees/<id>` (or `git worktree remove --force …`, or any operation that unlinks the worktree's `tasks.md`) from a terminal outside the dashboard
- **THEN** within the watcher's debounce window (< 1s) the server broadcasts a WS event `{ type: "agent-job-removed", jobId, changeId }`
- **AND** the client's store deletes `jobs[jobId]`, `jobOutputs[jobId]`, and the matching `worktreeProgress[changeId]` entry
- **AND** on the next render, the Kanban card for `changeId` returns to the TODO column (its `change.progress` is used; no ghost `hasActiveJob`)

#### Scenario: External discard on a running agent
- **GIVEN** an agent process is currently running and its worktree is externally removed
- **THEN** the runner emits `agent-job-removed` for the job but does NOT explicitly kill the process
- **AND** the runner logs a warning that a live agent had its worktree removed out from under it
- **AND** the process, whose cwd is gone, will detect the missing directory itself and exit shortly after

#### Scenario: UI-driven Discard is unchanged
- **WHEN** the user clicks the Kanban card's Discard button (which routes through the existing Discard flow)
- **THEN** the runner's normal Discard path fires (kill process if running → remove worktree → delete branch → broadcast `agent-job-finished` or the current UI-driven event)
- **AND** the new `agent-job-removed` event is NOT broadcast for this case (the UI-driven path disposes its own watcher before removing, so the watcher's `unlink` handler doesn't fire — see `add-worktree-external-discard-detection`'s watcher-guard note)

#### Scenario: Unlink-only trigger, no directory
- **GIVEN** the enclosing `.worktrees/<id>/` directory is intact but only `tasks.md` was deleted (edge case: someone `rm`'d the file directly)
- **THEN** the runner still cleans up the job — the trigger is the watched file's `unlink`, not the containing directory's existence
- **AND** this is documented behavior; the runner's contract is "the tasks.md file is the source of truth for the worktree's aliveness"
