## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Run Button on Kanban Cards
The system SHALL render a Run action on TODO and IN-PROGRESS kanban cards
when at least one agent is defined in `agents.yaml`, and SHALL hide the
action otherwise.

#### Scenario: Single agent
- **WHEN** the agent registry has exactly one agent
- **THEN** the Run button starts that agent directly through a confirm modal

#### Scenario: Multiple agents
- **WHEN** the agent registry has more than one agent
- **THEN** the Run button opens a picker listing the agents by name and description; selecting one proceeds to the confirm modal

#### Scenario: Empty registry
- **WHEN** no agents are configured
- **THEN** no Run button is shown on cards and the kanban behaves exactly as before

### Requirement: Agent Status Badge
The system SHALL display the running state of the latest agent job on each
change card.

#### Scenario: Job running
- **WHEN** a change has an active agent job
- **THEN** the card shows a pulsing indicator with the agent name

#### Scenario: Job finished
- **WHEN** a change's latest job has finished
- **THEN** the card shows "✓ ready to merge" on success or "✗ failed" on a non-zero exit, until the user merges or discards

#### Scenario: Multiple runs over time
- **WHEN** the user has run the same change multiple times
- **THEN** the badge reflects the most recent job only

### Requirement: Agents Page
The system SHALL provide an Agents page at `/agents` accessible from the top
navigation, listing active jobs and recent finished jobs with per-job
output tails.

#### Scenario: Open the page
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Agents" in the top navigation
- **THEN** the dashboard navigates to `/agents` and shows active jobs first, then recent finished jobs

#### Scenario: Inspect a job
- **WHEN** the user opens a job
- **THEN** the dashboard shows its full output (live for running jobs, retained buffer for finished ones), the agent name, the change link, and Cancel / Merge / Discard actions as appropriate
