## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Revert Workflow
ithyno's spec-driven workflow SHALL support a documented "revert"
variant for changes that undo prior work. Every revert change SHALL
classify each of its target(s) as Case α (target already archived
before the revert lands) or Case β (target still in-flight when
the revert lands) and apply the appropriate disposition path.

#### Scenario: Revert change is named after its scope
- **GIVEN** a new revert change is being proposed
- **THEN** its id has the form `revert-<scope>` (scope may aggregate multiple targets under a single readable name)
- **AND** its frontmatter `tags:` includes `feature/revert`
- **AND** its proposal's Why section lists each reverted change id and classifies it as Case α or Case β

#### Scenario: Case α — archived target
- **GIVEN** the reverted target was archived before this revert lands
- **THEN** the target's ADDED spec deltas have already reached `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
- **AND** the revert change's own spec delta uses `MODIFIED` and/or `REMOVED` to undo those requirements
- **AND** the target's archive directory stays put; the revert's outcome links back to it

#### Scenario: Case β — in-flight target
- **GIVEN** the reverted target was still in `openspec/changes/` when this revert lands
- **THEN** the target's ADDED spec deltas never reached the specs
- **AND** the revert change's spec delta uses `ADDED` only, describing the post-revert baseline directly
- **AND** the target itself is archived alongside the revert, following the reverted-target archive procedure

#### Scenario: Reverted-target archive (Case β)
- **GIVEN** an in-flight target being archived as part of a revert
- **WHEN** the archive is prepared
- **THEN** the target's `specs/` subdirectory is deleted (its ADDED deltas would collide with the revert's new baseline)
- **AND** an `outcome.md` is written with title `# Outcome: <target-id> (reverted)`
- **AND** the outcome preserves ✅ Worked and ⚠️ Surprises sections from the actual implementation
- **AND** 🔁 Differently and 🌱 Follow-ups are replaced with a single bold pointer to the reverting change id
- **AND** the reverted-target archives complete BEFORE the reverting change's own archive

#### Scenario: Documentation lives in openspec-flow skill
- **THEN** the Revert section is documented in `.claude/skills/openspec-flow/SKILL.md` (and its `templates/` mirror)
- **AND** `CLAUDE.md` (and its templates mirror) cross-references the Revert section from the Standard order block
