## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Runtime Detection
The system SHALL detect at load time whether it is running inside a VS Code
webview (via `acquireVsCodeApi` availability) and expose that as a single
shared flag used by the orchestration and terminal capabilities.

#### Scenario: Detection in webview
- **WHEN** the dashboard loads inside a VS Code webview
- **THEN** the runtime flag is set to "vscode" for the duration of the page

#### Scenario: Detection outside VS Code
- **WHEN** the dashboard loads in a regular browser
- **THEN** the runtime flag is set to "standalone"
