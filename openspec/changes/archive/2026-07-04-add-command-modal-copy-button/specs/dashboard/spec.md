## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: CommandModal Copy Button
The dashboard's `CommandModal` SHALL expose an explicit "Copy
command" affordance that writes the current preview string to the
system clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. The affordance
SHALL be operable via mouse click on a top-right button and via
`Cmd+C` / `Ctrl+C` when no text is selected inside the modal. The
copied string SHALL be exactly what the Send button would inject
into the embedded terminal (mode-aware for archive / merge).

#### Scenario: Click copy writes preview to clipboard
- **GIVEN** a CommandModal is open with a preview command (e.g. `/ithy-opsx:archive add-foo`)
- **WHEN** the user clicks the copy button in the modal's top-right corner
- **THEN** `navigator.clipboard.writeText` is called with the exact preview string
- **AND** the button icon flips to a checkmark for ~1.2s then reverts

#### Scenario: Cmd+C copies when no selection
- **GIVEN** the modal is focused with no text selected
- **WHEN** the user presses `Cmd+C` (or `Ctrl+C`)
- **THEN** the copy flow fires as if the button were clicked
- **AND** the preview text lands in the clipboard

#### Scenario: Cmd+C with active selection defers to browser
- **GIVEN** the user has selected part of the preview text
- **WHEN** they press `Cmd+C`
- **THEN** the browser's default copy handling runs (copies the selection, not the whole preview)
- **AND** our handler does NOT override that behavior

#### Scenario: Clipboard permission denied surfaces toast
- **GIVEN** the browser has denied clipboard write permission
- **WHEN** the user clicks the copy button
- **THEN** the promise rejects
- **AND** an error toast appears: "Copy failed — clipboard permission not granted"
- **AND** the modal state is unchanged (icon does not flip)

#### Scenario: Mode-aware preview is copied verbatim
- **GIVEN** the modal's mode selector is on `cli` for an Archive action
- **WHEN** the user clicks copy
- **THEN** the clipboard contains `npx openspec archive <id>` (the `cli`-mode preview)
- **AND** flipping the mode selector to `claude` before clicking copies `/ithy-opsx:archive <id>` instead
