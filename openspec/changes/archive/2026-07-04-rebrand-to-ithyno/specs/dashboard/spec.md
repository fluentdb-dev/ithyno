## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: App Identity is "ithyno"
The app's user-visible identity SHALL be "ithyno". The workflow it
operates on SHALL continue to be referred to as "OpenSpec"
(directory `openspec/`, upstream CLI `openspec`, skills under
`.claude/skills/openspec-*`). The `ITHYNO_*` env-var namespace SHALL
supersede every `OPENSPEC_UI_*` / app-owned `OPENSPEC_*` variable
the app previously read.

#### Scenario: CLI banner names the app "ithyno"
- **WHEN** `bin/ithyno.js` starts the server successfully
- **THEN** stdout contains `✔  ithyno on http://localhost:<port>/?token=<hex>`
- **AND** no line refers to the app as "OpenSpec UI"
- **AND** upstream OpenSpec CLI references (`openspec archive` etc. in help text) remain intact

#### Scenario: Electron window and menu name "ithyno"
- **WHEN** the Electron shell opens a project
- **THEN** the window title is "ithyno"
- **AND** on macOS the App menu label reads "ithyno"
- **AND** the About dialog identifies the app as "ithyno"

#### Scenario: VS Code extension palette entries prefix "ithyno:"
- **WHEN** the packaged VSIX is installed and the user opens the command palette
- **THEN** the extension's commands appear as `ithyno: <action>` (e.g. `ithyno: Show Dashboard`)
- **AND** the extension's displayName in the Extensions view reads "ithyno"

#### Scenario: `ITHYNO_*` env vars override defaults
- **GIVEN** the environment contains `ITHYNO_SHELL=/usr/bin/fish` and `ITHYNO_TERMINAL_STARTUP=""`
- **WHEN** the embedded terminal opens
- **THEN** the PTY spawns `/usr/bin/fish`
- **AND** no auto-launch command runs (empty override)

#### Scenario: Legacy `OPENSPEC_UI_*` vars are NOT read
- **GIVEN** the environment contains `OPENSPEC_UI_SHELL=/usr/bin/fish` and nothing under `ITHYNO_*`
- **WHEN** the embedded terminal opens
- **THEN** the PTY spawns the platform default shell (as if no override existed)
- **AND** no compatibility shim reads the old variable

#### Scenario: Workflow terms remain unchanged
- **THEN** the `openspec/` directory name, `openspec` upstream CLI, and `.claude/skills/openspec-*` skill paths retain their OpenSpec-flavored names
- **AND** `/opsx:*` slash commands are unchanged (they are upstream)
- **AND** `/ithy-opsx:*` slash commands are unchanged (they were already ithyno-flavored)
